This breathtaking multigenerational saga takes readers on a journey through thousands of years of glorious Parisian history--from its founding under the Romans to the timeless love story of Abelard and Heloise against the backdrop of the building of Notre Dame; to the martyrdom of Joan of Arc during the Hundred Years War; to the dangerous manipulations of Cardinal Richelieu and the bloody religious conflicts between Catholics and Protestants; to the gilded glories of Versailles; to the horrors of the French Revolution and the conquests of Napoleon; to the beauty and optimism of the belle epoque when Impressionism swept the world; to the hotbed of cultural activity of the 1920s and &#039;30s that included Picasso, Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, and the writers of the Lost Generation; to the Nazi occupation and the incredible efforts of the French Resistance.

Even more richly detailed, thrilling, and romantic then anything Rutherfurd has written before, Paris: The Novel illuminates thousands of years in the City of Lights through intimate and vivid tales of characters both fictional and true, and with them, the sights, scents, and tastes of Paris come to sumptuous life.",4.3,"Paris, France","Fiction & Literature, Historical Fiction","1600s, 1700s, 1800s, 1900s, 2000s",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yaJQfkYnL.jpg"

1402294158,"The Paris Architect","Charles Belfoure","""A beautiful and elegant account of an ordinary man's unexpected and reluctant descent into heroism during the second world war."" --Malcolm Gladwell

A thrilling debut novel of World War II Paris, from an author who's been called ""an up and coming Ken Follett."" (Booklist)

In 1942 Paris, gifted architect Lucien Bernard accepts a commission that will bring him a great deal of money - and maybe get him killed. But if he's clever enough, he'll avoid any trouble. All he has to do is design a secret hiding place for a wealthy Jewish man, a space so invisible that even the most determined German officer won't find it. He sorely needs the money, and outwitting the Nazis who have occupied his beloved city is a challenge he can't resist.

But when one of his hiding spaces fails horribly, and the problem of where to hide a Jew becomes terribly personal, Lucien can no longer ignore what's at stake. The Paris Architect asks us to consider what we owe each other, and just how far we'll go to make things right.

Written by an architect whose knowledge imbues every page, this story becomes more gripping with every soul hidden and every life saved.",4.4,"Paris, France","Art & Architecture, Fiction & Literature, Historical Fiction, Mystery & Suspense","1900s",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y3TYivkAL.jpg"
1250067774,"A Paris Apartment","Michelle Gable","Bienvenue � Paris!

When April Vogt&#039;s boss tells her about an apartment in the ninth arrondissement that has been discovered after being shuttered for the past seventy years, the Sotheby&#039;s continental furniture specialist does not hear the words ""dust"" or ""rats"" or ""decrepit."" She hears Paris. She hears escape.

Once in France, April quickly learns the apartment is not merely some rich hoarder&#039;s repository. Beneath the cobwebs and stale perfumed air is a goldmine, and not because of the actual gold (or painted ostrich eggs or mounted rhinoceros horns or bronze bathtub). First, there&#039;s a portrait by one of the masters of the Belle Epoque, Giovanni Boldini. And then there are letters and journals written by the very woman in the painting, Marthe de Florian. These documents reveal that she was more than a renowned courtesan with enviable decolletage. Suddenly April&#039;s quest is no longer about the bureaux plats and Louis-style armchairs that will fetch millions at auction. It&#039;s about discovering the story behind this charismatic woman.

It&#039;s about discovering two women, actually.

With the help of a salty (and annoyingly sexy) Parisian solicitor and the courtesan&#039;s private diaries, April tries to uncover the many secrets buried in the apartment. As she digs into Marthe&#039;s life, April can&#039;t help but take a deeper look into her own. Having left behind in the States a cheating husband, a family crisis about to erupt, and a career she&#039;s been using as the crutch to simply get by, she feels compelled to sort out her own life too. When the things she left bubbling back home begin to boil over, and Parisian delicacies beyond flaky p�tisseries tempt her better judgment, April knows that both she and Marthe deserve happy finales.

Whether accompanied by croissants or champagne, this delectable debut novel depicts the Paris of the Belle Epoque and the present day with vibrant and stunning allure. Based on historical events, Michelle Gable&#039;s A Paris Apartment will entertain and inspire, as readers embrace the struggles and successes of two very unforgettable women.",4,"Paris, France","Fiction & Literature, Romance","1900s, 2000s, Recent Releases",,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Qf%2BHNZ5iL.jpg"
