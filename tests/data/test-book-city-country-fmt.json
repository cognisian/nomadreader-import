novel Ian McEwan really allows the avid reader a rare glimpse inside the mind of a well-seasoned neurosurgeon, which is in itself indeed an arduous task.  I found Henry to be a likeable character with humility eg. was aware of the first impression his somewhat unattractive skilled hands had on prospective patients.  When Henry is first confronted with Baxter and his two co-horts he portrays the \"fight\" or \"flight\" mechanism in a most unusual way; mentally diagnosing Baxter with a horrific neurological disorder, whilst reminding himself to stay on his feet during the impending altercation in an attempt to protect his own brain. Baxter becomes a character in his own right, however pitiful, and he draws the reader's sympathy not only with his dismal diagnosis, but his constant striving to be in control.  Mr. McEwan very cleverly has Baxter haunt Henry and eventually Henry's beloved family, until the inevitable confrontation which will completely surprise the reader and strip Henry of the aura of the white coated upstanding gifted neurosurgeon, to reveal a man, a father, and a husband determined to protect not only his family, but also Baxter.upstanding neurosurgeon's basic humanity"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A day in the life of neurosurgeon Henry Perowne, a Saturday. In this exercise in perspective taking, McEwan guides the reader through the thoughts of a man from the time he wakes in the morning until he returns to bed at night. As Henry\u2019s story unfolds second by second, the reader sees patterns emerge in his thought processes, which suggest that people have a significant influence, both on their own perspectives, and the outcomes of events. The author presses the reader to think about the complexity of the choices we make with each thought, each day.In just one day, so many thoughts and events occur, that most people never realize they exist. With a breakdown of Henry\u2019s ideas, memories, ruminations, McEwan poses the question: Is it possible that so much goes on in our minds, our lives, that we don\u2019t think about how and why? As the text moves along, the reader makes definitive distinctions between two categories of thoughts Henry possesses, which lead to similar emotions: some are happy, positive and some sad, negative. Might this be true for the reader, too?Through the lens of Henry, it is clear, a person can alter his own experiences of time or his sense of contentment with his associations. Henry\u2019s day flies by as he moves from thought to activity and back. He can feel young and blissful when thinking about his wife, their love, and how lucky he is to have her, for example. He\u2019s happy thinking of his son and daughter, music, snow. The reader sees what Henry fails to notice, that he can slow his perceptions of time, feel lonely and grim when he allows himself to obsess about negative events in the news or his mother\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s. When a traumatic event takes place later in the day, time stands still. The reader fully grasps the effect of perception on the human mind.What a day! McEwan creates a character and a story in which parallels are drawn to anyone who picks up this book. It is a statement about how so much of our lives are about choices. We are all left pondering more deeply the broader implications of our own thoughts and actions."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Very well written novel. Keeps you on your toes regarding what the main character is really thinking, plus the other main characters. Not an easy read but still good. I think I am going to reread just to make sure I understand."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "This book was so incredibly slow moving I just had to give up. The narrator had to think about and analyse every minute action that it became painful to read. Pages and pages on why and how he bought his current car, pages and pages on what was going through his head as he walked down the street. I'd read a fair bit of this book when I realised all he had done was wake up in the middle of the night, observe a scene out the widow and get ready to go out for a game of squash. Then I decided life was too short to keep reading. If you are an extremely patient and analytical person with lots of spare time you may find this to be a deep and meaningful read but it's not for me."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a very interesting book.  As is the case with works by Ian McEwan you spend a good portion of the book wondering when the explosion will occur.  In a sense, McEwan is, in my opinion, attempting to reflect modern anxieties.This is very much a story of haves vs have nots. Reason vs emotion. It probably will appeal more to Blue States than Red Staters even though it is set in the UK with a pre-Iraq War demonstration as its back drop.The book deals with the rational world of Henry Perowne, a 48 year old neurosurgeon, married to a lawyer with a daughter who is poet and son who is a jazz musician.  It is a rational, comfortable world that because of one instance in the book is bedeviled by the irrational forces that put liberal society at risk on a daily basis.  The veneer of civilization is quite thin indeed, regardless of what we imagine.  The world is full of ticking time bombs, be they terrorism, crime, or mental disorders.I am not sure how I would have felt about it, had I read this book nearer its publication date. The rush to war in Iraq, which is depicted in the book seems like a flight into madness and irrational thought.  There is no way McEwan could have imagined the full extent of the difficulties in waging war in another part of the world with a different history.  The outcome for the Perowne family is much easily resolved.  However, I think that McEwan does a great deal in defining what the stakes are and the contemporary threats to civilization."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "And excellent book by one of the best authors writing today.SATURDAY  is a tour de force of emotion, reflection, observationand action. A London family is violated by a fluke happenstance after the father confronts thugs on the way to his office.This is a riveting story, truly one of Ian Ewan's best."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "McEwan's story begins with an insomniac neurosurgeon gazing out his London home window and seeing a plane going down in flames at Heathrow.  It is 2003 and a huge peace rally is planned for the coming day.  The juxtaposition of the crashing plane and the expected peace picketers creates tension from the novel's opening placing all events against the 9 11 scenario.  Worried about the plane the surgeon goes down several flights of his 7,000 square foot near mansion into the basement kitchen where he finds his 18 year old talented blues musician son.  He tells him what he's just seen.  After a cozy cuppa with his son he goes back to bed where he makes love to his wife.  There's a slow push pull of domestic harmony against outside menaces that stalks him on his Saturday activities, activities which include a squash match with a colleague that gets ultra competitive, a traffic accident that leads to a dangerous encounter with a thug and his sidekicks, a visit to his loved but memory less mom wandering lost in her nursing home and then back to the bosom of his family for a reunion with his two grown children and his award winning but angsty poet father-in-law.  He lets the day's events play at the back of his mind as he enjoys preparing an elaborate fish stew with salad and wine to eat with his loved ones.  And then, as always happens in a McEwan novel, things get ugly, really ugly.  I don't want to spoil your reading experience so I won't say anymore about that.  McEwan ties up his plot threads more neatly than he usually does in this novel, there are less dangly bits.  Also, he gives us people who we can like, another departure from his norm.  For me Saturday was right up there with \"Atonement\" and \"On Chesil Beach\" on the enjoy ability scale."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This book was assigned to me by my instructor. Very disappointed because I have never read a book so boring, detailed, and dull. This author got off topic entirely too much, I wish he would just get straight to the point. Forced myself to read it up to the middle of chapter 2 until I just couldn't take it any longer. This book was horrible."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "By dint of surprisingly apt and often surprising metaphorical language and a masterful command of the use of detail to make a reader enter the time and space he is creating, McEwan can lead you to inhabit the mind of a neuro-surgeon for a long day, even succeeding in making you forget the unlikelihood of some of the incidents he narrates. It is a very eventful day, finally bringing together the surgeon's entire family and a couple of aggressive strangers. The beginning is somewhat slow, as what seems to be a portentous, minutely narrated occurrence dissolves into a not very significant event, except in its power to reveal the state of mind and the historical moment inhabited by the protagonist. His is a totally un-literary mind, yet the author can represent its intricate workings with delicacy and respect."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "This book had a plot but it was used like a clothesline upon which to hang vignettes (each of which was a description of one character, one family member). Each vignette could have been a short story. But I wasn't planning on reading a collection of short stories. The vignettes intruded even in the more intense moments in the story--like when they stop to sing a song in a musical-- just exactly when you want to know what is going to happen next. I guess the plot wasn't supposed to be the thing that mattered.There was also a lot of stream of consciousness. It was all thought provoking. (Maybe it will turn out that it was good that we went to Irac!) But the topics didn't seem to come together in a common thread that was perceptible to me.I am a neurologist and I thought he did very well on the neuroanatomical parts, but I kept wondering why anyone would want to become so prodigiously familiar with that material, just to write a story and then go on with other things.It is true that he writes wonderfully. But I thought that it was mostly parts and not so much whole."}], "rating": 3.7, "num_ratings": 459}, "latitude": 51.50853, "asin": "1400076196", "authors": ["Ian McEwan"], "readability": 0, "summary": "In his triumphant new novel, Ian McEwan, the bestselling author of Atonement, follows an ordinary man through a Saturday whose high promise gradually turns nightmarish. \r\n\r\nHenry Perowne\u2013a neurosurgeon, urbane, privileged, deeply in love with his wife and grown-up children\u2013plans to play a game of squash, visit his elderly mother, and cook dinner for his family.
